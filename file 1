<h1>reflection on the project</h1>
<p>
for this project I wanted to make a functioning game on javascript the first one wasnt so good as it required me to edit the code in about <strong>5</strong> places if I wanted to add another block. I fixed this in the end project by making a few arrays and doing something simillar to the make it rain project but changing the y values every time it cycled around.Now I just add one number to the Xpos array to make another block. Some problems I had with it For the final one I made a thing that displays a comment based on score wich took a while and sometimes cubes would glitch at the edges because of them being able to come from both sides so I covered it up with squares.I think I did especially good with the hit boxes and how polished it is. for improvements for next time I want to maybe add a powerup thing or/and a menu also for the last one I made a random comment show up at the end based on your score
